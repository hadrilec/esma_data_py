The *esma_data_py* package provides a robust toolkit designed to streamline the process of searching for and downloading data from the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) register. At the core of this package is *EsmaDataLoader*, an engine that simplifies the process of accessing and downloading regulatory data. This Python package facilitates easy access to reliable and up-to-date information, supporting financial analysts, researchers, and developers who need data from ESMA.

This package is a contribution to reproducible research and public data transparency.

## Key features

* **MIFID Data**: You can use the `load_mifid_file_list` method to fetch a list of MIFID files from specified ESMA databases filtering by creation or publication date.
* **FIRDS Data**: You can retrieve data both with the `load_latest_files`, applying filters by instrument type and optionally by CFI codes and ISINs, or with the `load_fca_firds_file_list` by retrieving a list of FCA files.
* **SSR Data**: You can retrieve SSR data with the `load_ssr_exempted_shares` method, optionally filtering the results to include only records relevant to the current date.
